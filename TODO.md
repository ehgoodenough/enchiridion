Make it less serious and gritty? Focusing on the action, like Hotline Miami or something? Enforced by color and sound?
Focus on the non-proc-gen level design, not worrying about asthetic just now, but how those levels could be interesting to fight through. Finding weapons, getting to bonfires, etc? Focus on boss design!!! Find a good good pun.
