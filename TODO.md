# Roguelike Ideation #

* traps
* pits, not walls
* texture on the ground
* non-square rooms
* open villages
* outside, made up of multiple screens
* lighting???
* square tiles with height for walls
* seeing things you can't get to yet
* overlapping back on itself

- Make it less serious and gritty? Focusing on the action, like Hotline Miami or something? Enforced by color and sound?
- Focus on the non-proc-gen level design, not worrying about asthetic just now, but how those levels could be interesting to fight through. Finding weapons, getting to bonfires, etc? Focus on boss design!!! Find a good good pun.
